Marimekko charts can be a great way to display distributions of data and to make full use of space. I'm a fan and I like building them but there is a bit of a barrier to entry as they include advanced table calculations and LODs (in Tableau at least). 

To help with this you can download the various available Marimekko charts published to Tableau public and replicate their calculations, but adapting them can be difficult. This blog is there to explain one of the key calculations behind the chart as I don't think anyone else has laid it out simply.
