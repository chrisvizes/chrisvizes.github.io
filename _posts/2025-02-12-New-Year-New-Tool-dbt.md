I'm taking a dive into the metaphorical pool of de-beot and to distill some longer term retention, I'm here to blog as we go. Who knows what format these will shape up to be, but the plan is to keep blogging as I go through courses on https://learn.getdbt.com/learn/

I'm starting with the dbt Fundamentals course, which is supposedly a very good way to start and takes roughly 5 hours.

### Why?

1. work
2. so my chillis can have the finest peat-free compost
