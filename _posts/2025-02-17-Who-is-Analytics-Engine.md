Okay so in this next section the objectives are...

# Learning Objectives

1. Explain the structure of traditional data teams.
2. Explain how advances in technology enabled the transition from ETL to ELT.
3. Explain the role of analytics engineer and the modern data team.
4. Explain how dbt fits into the modern data stack.
5. Understand the structure of a dbt project.

Okay so _traditional data teams_ have engineers and analysts (I'm dropping the use of 'data' in their names). Engineers are the backend people, getting data into databases in nice structures with cadences. Analysts sit downstream, playing in the data, building useful things with it. For the analyst to get the most of the the data, the engineers must do their jobs in different ways, and this requirement has led to a more _modern_ structure of having an analytics engineer, a bit of both.
