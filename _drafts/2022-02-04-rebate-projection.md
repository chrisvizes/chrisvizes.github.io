Very excited to post a new dashboard! 

In this one, I put on my business hat and analyse rebate projections, mocked with superstore data. It was great fun to build and I definitely spent too much time on aligning things.

The idea was:

If your business awards customers for meeting criteria and you value answering the question of "What if?", perhaps you could make use of a Tableau Dashboard that could help visualise the data.

I have made up some criteria for being rewarded, hitting a sales target, hitting a stretch sales target and displaying behaviour that the made up company would like and created a dashboard on top of that.

Check it out below
