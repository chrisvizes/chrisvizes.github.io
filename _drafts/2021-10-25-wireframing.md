Wireframing a dashboard or visualisation can be a great way to make an effective start at a dashboard and begin the iterative process to create good design. There are multiple free tools that are available to use and I wanted to write a little about what I use and how I use them to my advantage. 

When it comes to wireframing there are three keys requirements for me: the tool must be low cost or free, collaborative and easy to use. 

The two tools I have had most success with and want to share are Figma and Excalidraw.
