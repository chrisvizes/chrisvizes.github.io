## Learning Objectives

1. Explain what models are in a dbt project.
2. Build your first dbt model.
3. Explain how to apply modularity to analytics with dbt.
4. Modularize your project with the ref function.
5. Review a brief history of modeling paradigms.
6. Identify common naming conventions for tables.
7. Reorganize your project with subfolders.

**Staging** is 1-to-1 with the source data and includes light touch changes, column renames, convert units from seconds to hours.

**Intermediate models** somewhere between staging and final models. Might not be for end users. Only reference staging models, not source.

**Fact models** records of events, like orders, or website traffic.

**Dimension models** records of things that you keep up-to-date, like contacts or product inventory.

Config, like how to materialize a model, can be within the model but it may be more efficient to use the project yml file to set what each folder is matialized as.
