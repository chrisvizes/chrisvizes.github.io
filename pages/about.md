Welcome to my blog, here's a little bit about me and how I got here.

## My Current Role
I am a Consulting Analyst for The Information Lab. Here, I have received 4 months of dedicated Tableau and Alteryx training by some of the leading members in these communities (**[Data School](https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/)**). Following this training I have had placements in a variety of industries with roles such as: Senior Consulting Analyst, Consultant BI Development Analyst & Tableau and Alteryx Consultant at clients such as Techmodal, BAE Systems, ViacomCBS and Iris Softward Group. 

## University
I have a BSc in **Physics** from the University of Bristol where I took particular interest in my computational and experimental units.

While there I had the pleasure of working with the physics society **[Chaos](https://www.bristolchaos.com)** in a variety of roles, spending my final year as the President. The 18-person strong committee managed to achieve the Best Academic & Careers Society award from the National Union of Students in 2018.

## Communication
A passion of mine revolves around tutoring and science communication. Helping someone achieve a lightbulb moment and get enthusiastic about a subject has been a focus of mine across a variety of roles and I am always looking to help others. I've been a personal tutor, an overseas academic mentor, a study session leader and I am now translating this experience over to the world of data visualisation and analytics.

## Uni-Truths Ltd
As a Director of [Uni-Truths](https://www.uni-truths.com), I have helped evolve this web platform into a tool used all over the world within their university communities. Within this role I gained my initial experience and interest in Tableau Desktop to firstly see what the software could do for me, but evolved into creating a variety of dashboards to provide analytics into the business itself.
