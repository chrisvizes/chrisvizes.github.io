Welcome to my bog, here's a little bit about me and how I got here.

## My Current Role

I am part of The Information Lab. Here, I obliterate Tableau problems, juggle data with Alteryx, team up with AI to write code, see what fits into APIs and demo the dos and donts. Even a little data engineering.

## University

I have a BSc in **Physics** from the University of Bristol where I took particular interest in my computational and experimental units.

While there I had the pleasure of working with the physics society **[Chaos](https://www.bristolchaos.com)** in a variety of roles, spending my final year as the President. The 18-person strong committee managed to achieve the Best Academic & Careers Society award from the National Union of Students in 2018. 3 big booms.

## Teaching

I love working with people to help them achieve a lightbulb moment and get enthusiastic about a subject. I've been a personal tutor, an overseas academic mentor, a study session leader and over the last 5 years taught Tableau and Alteryx through demonstrations, one-on-ones, office hours and full blown training.

## Uni-Truths Ltd

As a Director of [Uni-Truths](https://www.uni-truths.com), I helped evolve this web platform into a tool used all over the world within their university communities. Within this role I gained my initial experience and interest in Tableau Desktop to firstly see what the software could do for me, but evolved into creating a variety of dashboards to provide analytics into the business itself.

## Chillies

I also love to grow chillies. At the time of writing this I've got 90 little seedlings and it's very exciting.
