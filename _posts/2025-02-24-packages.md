To use packages in your projects you need to create a packages configuration file within the project structure. Why not call it `packages.yml` too and it can live at the top level of the files.

They look something like:

```yml
packages:
  - package: dbt-labs/audit_helper
    version: 0.12.1
```

and to use these dependencies in your project you must install them using:

`dbt deps`

and that's all I have on that for now...
