## **What Is Agentic Analytics — And Why Tableau Next Is a Big Deal**

When I first heard the phrase _agentic analytics_, I thought it sounded like something straight out of marketing. Maybe a buzzword that would pass in a few months. But after spending time hands-on with Tableau Next, it’s clear this isn’t just a new feature, it’s a different way of thinking about analytics entirely.

If you’ve worked in data for a while, you’re used to a fairly linear process: connect to the data, clean and model it, build a dashboard, share it, and maybe (if you’re lucky) see someone take action based on it. This cycle often feels manual, repetitive, and disconnected from the real decisions people are trying to make day to day.

Agentic analytics provides an alternative model.

### From dashboards to decisions; with help from AI

Agentic analytics is about _giving AI agents a seat at the analytics table_. These agents aren't just there to make your dashboard look smart. They're there to **work with you**, helping carry out tasks that would otherwise eat up your time or sit forgotten in a backlog.

In Tableau Next, this shows up in a few ways. Most visibly, you can ask questions of your data directly inside a dashboard using something called **Concierge**. You type in a natural-language question like “Which regions saw a dip in profit last quarter?” and Concierge will find the answer using your underlying metrics. If it needs clarification, it will ask. If the insight points to a problem, it can even recommend next steps or help you take them.

But that’s just one layer.

### Tableau Next isn’t just about AI it’s built to work with AI

What makes Tableau Next unique is that it’s not just bolting on a chatbot to your charts. The whole platform is designed to be **agent-friendly from the ground up**. Everything from how data is stored, to how models are built, to how actions are triggered is built with AI in mind.

There’s a **data layer** (powered by Salesforce’s Data Cloud) that gives real-time access to your data across systems without having to move it around. Then a **semantic layer** that lets you build trusted definitions and business logic that AI agents can actually understand. On top of that, you build your visualisations and dashboards. Finally, there’s the **action layer**, where insights don’t just sit around—they trigger real things to happen.

This structure means that agents aren’t just passive tools. They become collaborators in your workflow. They can monitor metrics, catch issues before you do, suggest solutions, and even kick off processes in tools like Salesforce.

### So what’s in it for businesses?

If you’ve ever built a dashboard only to be asked the same follow-up questions again and again—or watched a report sit unread because no one knew what to do with it, agentic analytics will feel like a breath of fresh air.

It closes the loop. Instead of making people jump from insight to action manually, Tableau Next lets them ask, understand, and act _in the same place_. For teams who live in Salesforce or work cross-functionally, this means faster responses, fewer dropped balls, and more decisions made at the speed of business.

It’s still early days, and not every feature will feel fully mature yet. But the direction of travel is clear and it’s exciting. We’re moving from dashboards as destinations to dashboards as launchpads. Tableau Next isn’t just about seeing the data. It’s about _doing something with it_.
