As part of learning about dbt Cloud I started the dbt Fundamentals course at [https://learn.getdbt.com/](https://learn.getdbt.com/)

It felt like a great introduction to the basic concepts of what dbt Cloud is and how it can simply be used. There was of course not any depth on any topics, sticking to the high level basic concepts. The practices were a great hands on task, but still a little odd to set up.

dbt Cloud feels great for established processes and introducing change to them, but starting from a blank slate in a demo environment is a bit difficult as you have to fill in some of the blanks. The dbt Cloud _instance?_ I was in was a shared one and I could only work in a branch off main, so no merging, deploying or anything like that could be done.

## Next Steps

I want to follow the dbt Certified Developer Path with the goal of attaining the certification. This is 4-5x the length of the course I did and I struggled to focus on that one. Perhaps it will be easier to engage on more advanced and interesting topics.

A project to work on would help me focus on the learning (I think). Looks like I might have one coming up! In fact, hearing that, I think I'm going to get started on the next course right away.
